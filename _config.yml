headline: Welcome to my portfolio!
description: >-
  I’m a Robotics Systems Engineering student with a background in IT and cybersecurity, which has helped me understand how to build smart, efficient, and secure systems. I have practical experience programming in C, C++, and Python, working with STM32 microcontrollers for embedded system design, and controlling mecanum-wheeled robots using RoboClaw motor drivers. I have also explored autonomous navigation with the Agilex LIMO robot using ROS 1 (Melodic), gaining hands-on experience in system integration, testing, and debugging. Additionally, I have used SolidWorks for 3D modeling and mechanical design. I really enjoy learning by building and experimenting, and I’m always excited to take on challenges that help me grow and improve!
